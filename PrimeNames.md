# Prime Names (Medium)
Lots of programming exercises will have you write a function that determines if an input number is prime. That's boring. For this challenge, you'll write a program that takes a string as input and returns whether the value of that string is a prime number. By:
  1. Splitting the string by character
  2. Adding the [ASCII values](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_ord.asp) of the characters in the string
  3. Determining if that sum is a prime number

### Input
`BobbyBearcat`
### Output
```
Sum: 1184
NOT PRIME
```

### Input
`RobertaBearcat`
### Output
```
Sum: 1409
PRIME
```
