# Video Games (Medium)
David, Sarah, and Mike are all friends that share their video game collections. They all share different video games so that only one of them needs to own it for them all to play it. Their favorite games right now are NBA2K26, Wii Sports, and HALO Reach.

Initially, David has NBA2K26, Sarah has Wii Sports, and Mike has HALO Reach. Over time, the games are passed around between the friends and it can be hard to keep track of who has each game.
