# Trevanion (Easy)
Trevanion's Cipher is an old concealment cipher that probably does not date back to the [English Civil War](https://cryptiana.web.fc2.com/code/trevanion.htm). For this challenge, write a program that finds a Secret Message $^{TM}$ in a passage of text by selecting the third letter after punctuation.
### Input
`Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all probability- a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence several miles above the surface of: an alien planet and, since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this poor innocent creature had very little time; to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with not being a whale any more`
### Output
`panic` 
<br>
<br>
*This passage is from "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". Any moral indignation about the fate of the whale should be directed at Douglas Adams, not me.*
